A DFA is a finite-state machine that accepts or rejects a given string of symbols by running through a state sequence uniquely determined by the given string.



#### State
A system is called stateful if it is designed to remember preceding events or user interaction; the remembered information is called a state.

#### Finite-state machine
Finite-state machine or more simply a state machine is a digital machine that can be in one of a number of finite state at a given moment. The machine change state in response of a user input. This change of state is called a transition.

Ex. A computer is a finite-state machine as it can be in three states : On, Off or Sleep
