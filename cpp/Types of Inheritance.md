In cpp, there's two type of inheritance :

##### Interface Inheritance
An object of a derive class can be used wherever an object of the base class must be used. Polymorphism models an `interface-based` interface, where multiple classes can share the same interface (base class) but provide different implementation

##### Implementation Inheritance
A base class provides functions or data that simplifies the usage of a derived class. Some function might be already implemented in the base class so that they can be used directly into the derive class.
